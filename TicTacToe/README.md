## Tik Tak Toe 

### Rules

- X always goes first.
- Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either:
- One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
 - All nine squares are filled.
 - If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, that player wins.
 - If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

Start with the following definition:
```
Public class TikTakToeService
{
	Public string Play(int row, int column)
	{
	}
}
```
